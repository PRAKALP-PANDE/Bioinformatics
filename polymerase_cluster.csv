7,abstract we have previously shown the presence of multiple small leadercontaining rna species in mouse hepatitis virus mhvinfected cells in this paper we have analyzed the origin structure and mechanism of synthesis of these small rnas using cdna probes specific for leader rna and genes a d and f we demonstrate that subsets of these small rnas were derived from the various viral genes these subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes varying with the gene from which they are derived the size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure whose free energy ranges from 16 to 771 kcalmol in each of the mrnas examined in addition identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate ri rna suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates the biological significance of these small rnas is further supported by the detection of leadercontaining rnas of 47 50 and 57 nucleotides in length which correspond to the crossover sites in two mhv recombinant viruses these data coupled with the high frequency of rna recombination during mhv infection suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure thereby generating pools of free leadercontaining rna intermediates which can reassociate with the template acting as primers for the synthesis of fulllength or recombinant rnas these data suggest that mhv transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which rna polymerase allows the partial rna products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription,-0.216274548,-0.08016528,0.061687085,0.060045245,-0.090364233,-0.134897608,0.080221545,-0.072288627,-0.003641245,-0.020928572,-0.055957017,-0.090069595,0.089825112,0.035120754,-0.011709426,-0.147087357,0.043321684,-0.087026677,-0.029653609,0.012851862,0.016454336,-0.017953532,0.044207549,0.040439121,0.051741681,0.05760139,0.042185526,-0.015887078,-0.003527309,-0.008950195,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

22,abstract rnarna recombination is thought to occur preferentially at certain selected sites and in only a few rna viruses the mechanism for these restrictions is unknown in this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus using polymerase chain reaction in the absence of selection pressure our results showed that within a 1kb region of the peplomer gene rna recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site thus coronavirus rna recombination appears to be more random than previously realized however after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported hot spot for coronavirus recombination these results suggest that rna recombination is common and random in nature but only certain recombinants can be selected thus the presence of recombinational hot spots for coronavirus or other rna viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of rna recombination the failure to detect recombinants in other rna viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses this approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses,-0.126897331,-0.036720288,0.033243359,0.107069174,0.007381706,-0.111569643,0.04956461,-0.008590464,0.051028443,-0.100940545,-0.007078501,-0.053666236,0.027318118,0.026412762,0.009862264,-0.088747285,-0.019468955,-0.112205638,-0.129645876,-0.040168775,-0.057057909,-0.113338808,-0.063165754,-0.003446389,-0.0215942,-0.010779278,-0.080722085,0.048167337,0.04064924,-0.032304133,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

24,abstract several biochemical properties and the sequence of the fusion glycoprotein f have indicated that turkey rhinotracheitis virus trtv is a pneumovirus subfamily pneumovirinae of the paramyxoviridae family as trtv was known to generate polycistronic mrnas cdna was generated from trtv strain u k3 bv85infected vero cell mrnas using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the f gene sequencing of four cdnas revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning 3 end of the f gene was that for the matrix m protein ie that trtv had the partial gene order 3mf5 this was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial rs virus the type species of the genus pneumovirus has the partial gene order 3mshgf5 where sh and g are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein respectively instead trtv resembled the morbillivirus and paramyxovirus genera of the paramyxoviridae subfamily paramyxoviridae which have the partial gene order 3mf5 two further oligonucleotides one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the m gene and the other oligo b to a sequence near the beginning of the f gene with their 5 ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cdna sequence were used in a polymerase chain reaction pcr using genomic rna as template only a pcr product of 03 kb was obtained the same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic rna from three other trtv strains sa91 78 uk854485 and sa238188 which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures in addition pcr was performed using genomic rna from trtv3bv and sa238188 with oligo b and another oligonucleotide near the 5 end of the gene upstream from m spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data only a 114kb pcr product was obtained larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between m and f the absence of such larger products plus the demonstration that infected cells contained mf dicistronic mrnas supported the conclusion that in the trtv genome the m gene is adjacent to the f gene in the order 3mf5 the 5 termini of the m and f mrnas were confirmed by mrna mapping the trtv m gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids very similar to that of rs virus 256 residues 37 amino acid identity but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses approximately 350 residues thus on the basis of the sequences of both the m and the f genes trtv is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses,-0.172004216,0.027863806,-0.064838622,0.166440615,-0.140283263,-0.018968199,0.108768196,-0.03668067,-0.104116932,0.078545995,-0.073776109,0.076992355,-0.03875528,-0.034358576,0.029583155,0.025252743,-0.028315646,-0.061461013,-0.037747422,0.021424215,0.034467507,-0.063599839,-0.003933693,-0.044752911,0.011632814,0.076959893,0.078351036,-0.074118798,-0.025913235,-0.003740392,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

28,abstract a comparison of the sequence of the dengue2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain 16681pdk53 derived from it identified 53 of the 10723 nucleotides which differed between the strains nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins and in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions twentyseven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations the greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prm 220 2 91 amino acids followed by the m protein 133 1 75 amino acids the c protein 088 1 114 amino acid and the e protein 061 3 495 amino acids differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 151  6 398 amino acids in ns4 to 033  3 900 amino acids in ns5 the encoded protein sequences of 16681pdk53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighborjoining tree method the analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicaselike proteins ns5 and ns3 respectively with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks,-0.145088763,-0.015153466,-0.068094412,0.104722215,-0.073540633,0.033024153,0.047506089,-0.015230149,-0.067475022,0.014733832,0.064810053,0.155820127,-0.083295974,-0.064023373,0.0605764,0.063035406,-0.000565861,0.057662156,-0.051961029,-0.049271142,-0.004000873,0.031632219,-0.093560048,-0.047133175,-0.06477475,-0.031517118,0.052811478,0.062941832,0.016461021,-0.037331115,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
29,abstract mouse hepatitis virus has been shown to undergo rna recombination at high frequency during mixed infection temperaturesensitive mutants were isolated using 5fluorouracil and 5azacytidine as mutagen six rna mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the s glycoprotein gene of mhva59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature using standard genetic techniques a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated f1 and f2 these genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the s1 and s2 glycoproteins respectively and suggest that both the s1 and s2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the s glycoprotein gene in addition assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 40 kb apart a recombination frequency of 1  per 575676 by was predicted through the s glycoprotein gene interestingly this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region the increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions 50 bp but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination a variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the s gene,-0.124359103,-0.020993051,-0.049263116,0.082901598,-0.048008965,-0.010719738,0.026188997,0.00108973,0.008745979,-0.067199218,0.044607785,0.006325519,0.004202171,-0.002891452,-0.051647266,-0.050827833,-0.000552619,-0.078094567,-0.15525967,-0.065693102,0.002807845,-0.079826196,-0.104518284,0.018839348,-0.032189923,-0.003305358,-0.03760561,0.126084969,0.015423767,0.007968584,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

54,abstract a consensus sequence for the human long interspersed repeated dna element l1h8 line or kpni sequence is presented the sequence contains two open reading frames orfs which are homologous to orfs in corresponding regions of l1 elements in other species the l1h8 orfs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region the 5 end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high gc content with numerous stretches of weak homology with alui repeats the 5 orf extends for a minimum of 723 bp 241 codons the 3 orf is 3843 bp 1281 codons and predicts a protein of 149 kd which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases the 3 end of the consensus has a 208bp nonconserved region followed by an adeninerich end the organization of the l1h8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mrnas except for the noncoding region between orfs however due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mrna that can be translated our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions suggests that most l1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes an estimate of the mammalian l1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements from this it follows that the majority of human l1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years the human elements studied here differ from each other yet overall the l1h8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of speciesspecificity when compared to the l1 families of other mammals possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the l1 family are discussed these include pseudogene formation retroposition transposition gene conversion and rna recombination,-0.140457409,-0.034186003,-0.062781803,0.118153407,-0.093654637,-0.043585107,0.06410927,-0.079698502,-0.072454651,0.022995329,-0.012324512,0.126572844,-0.013108891,-0.037612492,0.010069128,-0.013772628,0.027196015,-0.017882531,-0.034283833,-0.059925932,-0.031575328,-0.027115304,0.027449542,-0.015169028,0.024307637,-0.054569049,-0.057975877,-0.037294133,0.026226337,-0.002994193,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

61,this review explores the broad mechanisms of virus resistance this will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankinds best efforts at control the review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein eg polymerase protease integrase sialidase all viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance random point mutations those viruses which have segmented genomes have an additional mechanism genetic reassortment for antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance for the therapy of chronic viral infections such as hiv the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance in some cases the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced fitness but there may also be other unexpected effects conceptually one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity however some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virusinfected cell we end by asking the question how will viruses respond to such an indirect challenge,-0.068487065,-0.055853196,0.106406362,-0.034363813,0.097701174,0.084759587,-0.058425154,0.061359181,-0.029993359,-0.057720578,-0.025687331,0.071543836,-0.004374945,-0.03174734,0.081198663,-0.007156423,0.069977315,-0.029226039,0.018684262,-0.053382363,-0.068904377,-0.070766493,-0.078316158,0.00213616,0.015312956,0.013588885,-0.029592622,-0.075050572,-0.03480967,-0.004859054,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

152,abstract subgenomic rna transcription of coronaviruses involves the interaction between the leader or antileader and the intergenic ig sequences however it is not clear how these two sequences interact with each other in this report a previously unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mrna termed mrna51 was identified in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus mhv strains jhm2c jhm2 jhm3 a59 and mhv1 sequence analysis revealed that the leaderbody fusion site of the mrna is located at approximately 150 nucleotides nt downstream of the consensus ig sequence for mrna 5 and did not have sequence homology with any known ig consensus sequences to determine whether this sequence functions independently as a promoter we cloned a 140nt sequence from 70 nt upstream to 70 nt downstream of the fusion site from viral genomic rna and placed it in front of a reporter gene in the defectiveinterfering di rnachloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat reporter vector transfection of the reporter rna into mhvinfected cells resulted in synthesis of a catspecific subgenomic mrna detected by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr the strength of this promoter was similar to that of the ig7 for mrna 7 as measured by the cat activity deletion analysis showed that the sequence as few as 13 nt was sufficient to initiate mrna transcription while mutations within the 13nt abolished mrna transcription in vitro translation study confirmed that the envelope e protein was translated from mrna51 which encodes the open reading frame orf 5b at its 5end indicating that mrna51 is a functional message furthermore when the orf5b was replaced with the cat gene and placed in the di in the context of viral minigenome cat was expressed not only from the first orf of mrna51 but also from the second and third orf of mrna5 and genomic di rna respectively suggesting that more than one mechanism is involved in regulation of orf5b expression our findings thus support the notion that basepairing between the leader or antileader and the ig is not the sole mechanism in subgenomic rna transcription,-0.246434622,-0.084878749,-0.047607018,0.11031507,-0.194191717,-0.075728755,0.148176967,-0.154214064,-0.052138629,0.081202354,-0.106267368,-0.008286847,0.057413936,-0.00159634,0.003040773,-0.071314915,0.069996172,-0.081538024,-0.015161524,-0.000839238,0.028649773,-0.015861114,0.035431528,0.142937462,0.083173813,0.022357114,0.082533238,-0.080265946,0.005073708,-0.007962943,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
153,abstract the subgenomic rna 3 of ibv has been shown to be a tricistronic mrna encoding three products in ibvinfected cells to explore if the least expressed orf orf 3b which encodes a nonstructural protein is evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for viral propagation in cultured cells the beaudette strain of ibv was propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages and then adapted to a monkey kidney cell line vero the 3b gene of passage 3 in embryonated eggs and passages 7 15 20 25 30 35 50 and 65 in vero cells were amplified by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and sequenced the results showed that viral rna extracted from passages 35 50 and 65 contained a single a insertion in a 6a stretch of the 3b gene between nucleotides 24075 and 24080 whereas the early passages carried the normal 3b gene this insertion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore if expressed a cterminally truncated protein we showed that the frameshifting product cloned in a plasmid was expressed in vitro and in cells transfected with the mutant construct the normal product of the 3b gene is 64 amino acids long whereas the frameshifting product is 34 amino acids long with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues at the nterminal half immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a free distribution pattern indicating that the cterminal portion of 3b was responsible for its nuclear localization comparison of the complete genome sequences 276 kb of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 from passages 20 and 36 respectively revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions two in the 195kda protein encoded by gene 1 and one in the s protein in addition to the frameshifting 3b product further characterization of the two isolates demonstrated that p36c12 showed growth advantage over p20c22 in both vero cells and chicken embryos and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22 these results suggest that the 3b gene product is not essential for the replication of ibv,-0.160830301,-0.005426355,-0.071448628,0.077053428,-0.139037699,0.077472872,0.087576804,0.076674514,-0.032569499,0.061788856,-0.038358654,0.021770996,-0.037025306,-0.01818985,-0.040339444,0.065563552,-0.01931377,0.045395173,0.011761751,0.01046351,0.010398554,-0.02712481,-0.052229273,-0.041675278,-0.012411469,-0.065081461,0.029292454,-0.001133727,0.009703898,-0.008778234,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

155,abstract murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv causes encephalitis and demyelination in the central nervous system of susceptible rodents astrocytes are the major target for mhv persistence however the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive mhv infection and permit viral persistence are not known here we performed dna microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte dbt cells by mhv infection and found that the mrna of the proapoptotic gene bnip3 was significantly decreased following mhv infection this finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction western blot analysis and bnip3promoterluciferase reporter system interestingly infection with live and ultraviolet lightinactivated viruses equally repressed bnip3 expression indicating that the downregulation of bnip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry furthermore treatment of cells with chloroquine which blocks the acidification of endosomes significantly inhibited the repression of the bnip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic phdependent mhv mutant oblv60 which enters cells via endocytosis indicating that the downregulation of bnip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588basepair bnip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the bnip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for mhvinduced downregulation of bnip3 expression in dbt cells these results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which mhv evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes,-0.139032293,-0.049808964,-0.014438554,-0.069061078,-0.073222101,0.098189719,-0.013301173,0.00232484,-0.079753097,0.12612558,-0.116080458,-0.100975297,0.0440606,0.00291329,0.024758775,-0.029052901,-0.015501862,-0.096813008,-0.061295335,0.00449067,-0.003073072,-0.045879661,-0.029152408,0.04433459,0.024870518,-0.013203249,0.078917348,-0.032380852,-0.029049401,-0.025492647,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

179,abstract the murine coronavirus polymerase gene is 22 kb in length with the potential to encode a polyprotein of approximately 750 kda the polyprotein has been proposed to encode three proteinase domains which are responsible for the processing of the polyprotein into mature proteins the proteolytic activity of the first proteinase domain has been characterized and resembles the papain family of cysteine proteinases this proteinase domain acts autoproteolytically to cleave the amino terminal portion of the polymerase polyprotein releasing a 28kda protein designated p28 to identify the cleavage site of this papainlike cysteine proteinase we isolated the peptide adjacent to p28 and determined the amino terminus sequence by edman degradation reaction we report that proteolysis occurs between the gly247 and val248 dipeptide bond to determine the role of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage site we introduced a total of 42 sitespecific mutations at the residues spanning the p5 to p3 positions and assessed the effects of the mutations on the processing of p28 in an in vitro transcription and translation system the substitutions of gly247 at the p1 position or arg246 at the p2 position resulted in a dramatic decrease of proteolytic activity and the mutations of arg243 at p5 position also led to considerable reduction in p28 cleavage in contrast the substitutions of amino acids gly244 p4 tyr245 p3 val248 p1 lys249 p2 and pro250 p3 had little or no effect on the amount of p26 that was released this work has identified gly247val248 as the cleavage site for the release of p28 the aminoterminal protein of the murine coronavirus polymerase polyprotein additionally we conclude that the gly247 and arg246 are the major determinants for the cleavage site recognition by the first papainlike cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus,-0.144796715,-0.054189197,-0.041884403,0.004452453,-0.070244472,0.011127228,0.030952532,-0.037299574,-0.043449894,0.069342761,0.048179723,0.139941374,-0.077420215,-0.024169995,0.007848593,0.095230445,-0.040522797,0.086899057,0.041807144,-0.013715122,0.015329187,0.040470732,-0.03065077,0.036008767,-0.039873751,-0.119498487,-0.044757644,-0.007798908,0.025954579,-0.033131957,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

447,summary the current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses cannot be established for two reasons firstly viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin with several sets of viruses arising by different independent routes at different times secondly subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different hostvector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material thus depending on the gene product used for comparison different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes gene duplication deletions frameshift mutations point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing unused reading frames the solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins the solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders for rna viruses the major criterion is the sequence identity of the rnadependent rna polymerase using this criterion the positive strand rna viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of rna viruses these five classes contain four three three three and one orders respectively these fourteen orders contain 31 virus families including 17 families of plant viruses and 48 genera including 30 genera of plant viruses this approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families the togaviridae and flaviridae but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments such as the pestiviruses hepatitis c virus rubiviruses hepatitis e virus and arteriviruses may be wrong the coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified in addition the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the potexviridae from an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsrna viruses it appears that they are not closely related to each other but belong to four additional classes partitiviridae reoviridae birnaviridae and cystoviridae and one additional order totiviridae of one of the classes of positive ssrna viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand rna viruses the negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the rna viruses this review includes preliminary data suggesting that the dna viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved dna polymerases the suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal rna gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy this review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement the level of sequence identity and to a lesser extent particle morphology,-0.124425893,-0.050064155,0.070419106,0.159946862,0.055885923,-0.071633639,0.016983311,-0.015693393,-0.052230733,-0.110256788,-0.052216137,0.002094646,0.011810522,-0.014444065,0.081445458,-0.029585459,-0.002003196,-0.001163082,-0.039982614,-0.077790027,-0.111641009,-0.063137866,0.017798661,-0.103588893,-0.007190429,0.007003155,-0.162488261,-0.053560008,-0.002322765,-0.002840584,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1704,mouse hepatitis virus mhv a coronavirus has been shown to undergo a high frequency of rna recombination both in tissue culture and in animal infection so far rna recombination has been demonstrated only between genomic rnas of two coinfecting viruses to understand the mechanism of rna recombination and to further explore the potential of rna recombination we studied whether recombination could occur between a replicating mhv rna and transfected rna fragments we first used rna fragments which represented the 5 end of genomicsense sequences of mhv rna for transfection by using polymerase chain reaction amplification with two specific primers we were able to detect recombinant rnas which incorporated the transfected fragment into the 5 end of the viral rna in the infected cells surprisingly even the antigenomicsense rna fragments complementary to the 5 end of mhv genomic rna could also recombine with the mhv genomic rnas this observation suggests that rna recombination can occur during both positive and negativestrand rna synthesis furthermore the recombinant rnas could be detected in the virion released from the infected cells even after several passages of virus in tissue culture cells indicating that these recombinant rnas represented functional virion rnas the crossover sites of these recombinants were detected throughout the transfected rna fragments however when an rna fragment with a ninenucleotide cuuuauaaa deletion immediately downstream of a pentanucleotide ucuaa repeat sequence in the leader rna was transfected into mhvinfected cells most of the recombinants between this rna and the mhv genome contained crossover sites near this pentanucleotide repeat sequence in contrast when exogenous rnas with the intact ninenucleotide sequence were used in similar experiments the crossover sites of recombinants in viral genomic rna could be detected at moredownstream sites this study demonstrated that recombination can occur between replicating mhv rnas and rna fragments which do not replicate suggesting the potential of rna recombination for genetic engineering,-0.253576753,-0.099798451,0.059406738,0.085270015,-0.113506214,-0.185730235,0.126916324,-0.072526839,0.047759243,-0.067854484,-0.062903826,-0.141368051,0.107619394,0.074008873,-0.013508726,-0.178815467,0.073770218,-0.150129334,-0.057950627,0.025699777,0.056075809,-0.067842472,-0.069778433,0.012015263,-0.013280605,-0.000256428,0.055471497,0.005311022,0.031619049,-0.007344833,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1705,mouse hepatitis virus mhv synthesizes seven to eight mrnas each of which contains a leader rna derived from the 5 end of the genome to understand the mechanism of synthesis of these mrnas we studied how the synthesis of each mrna was affected by uv irradiation at different time points after infection when mhvinfected cells were uv irradiated at a late time in infection 5 h postinfection the syntheses of the various mrnas were inhibited to different extents in proportion to the sizes of the mrnas analysis of the uv inactivation kinetics revealed that the uv target size of each mrna was equivalent to its own physical size in contrast when cells were irradiated at 25 or 3 h postinfection there appeared to be two different kinetics of inhibition of mrna synthesis the synthesis of every mrna was inhibited to the same extent by a small uv dose but the remaining mrna synthesis was inhibited by additional uv doses at different rates for different mrnas in proportion to rna size the analysis of the uv inactivation kinetics indicated that the uv target sizes for the majority of mrnas were equivalent to that of the genomicsize rna early in the infection these results suggest that mhv mrna synthesis requires the presence of a genomiclength rna template at least early in the infection in contrast later in the infection the sizes of the templates used for mrna synthesis were equivalent to the physical sizes of each mrna the possibility that the genomiclength rna required early in the infection was used only for the synthesis of a polymerase rather than as a template for mrna synthesis was ruled out by examining the uv sensitivity of a defective interfering di rna we found that the uv target size for the di rna early in infection was much smaller than that for mrnas 6 and 7 which are approximately equal to or smaller in size than the di rna this result indicates that even though di rna and viral mrnas are synthesized by the same polymerase mrnas are synthesized from a larger genomiclength template we conclude that a genomiclength rna template is required for mhv subgenomic mrna synthesis at least early in infection several transcription models are proposed,-0.172577147,-0.083218562,0.029210531,-0.032353355,-0.098771587,-0.071611125,0.056635002,-0.091552519,-0.005595333,0.012804194,-0.061521737,-0.104607364,0.110329113,0.049350146,-0.029367882,-0.126578224,0.050182648,-0.068104744,0.006073537,0.027957837,0.057181341,0.042749103,0.080518009,0.133363973,0.008267723,0.063580648,0.055870001,-0.036441153,0.028837562,-0.018090203,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1752,mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity however for many systems it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically in rna viruses an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability this argument has profound implications as it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations here we present data for an alternative model whereby rna viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed we find that a poliovirus antimutator 3dg64s has a significant replication defect and that wild type and 3dg64s populations have similar adaptability in two distinct cellular environments experimental evolution of 3dg64s under rselection led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype mice infected with 3dg64s exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the ld50 consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply furthermore compensation of the 3dg64s growth defect restored virulence while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy in contrast to what has been suggested for many rna viruses we find that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversitynnauthor summarymutation rate evolution has long been a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology the polymerases of rna viruses generally lack proofreading activity and exhibit extremely high mutation rates since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural selection we asked why hasnt the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate we used experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that rna virus mutation rates may actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive rather our data indicate that viral mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics we suggest that viruses have high mutation rates not because they facilitate adaption but because it is hard to be both fast and accurate,-0.100365012,-0.085855347,0.079758388,0.009009239,0.068684116,-0.009481312,-0.05721008,0.030500571,0.041708064,-0.144860001,0.045747077,-0.072315831,0.018527771,0.001071479,0.002616576,-0.062069343,-0.042517979,-0.033386158,-0.20687694,-0.082509436,-0.086345598,-0.071703845,-0.111771236,-0.045402255,-0.043522638,-0.074656784,-0.119634399,0.064937766,-0.056474083,0.010993576,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1809,abstract every step of the viral life cycle is dependent on the host which potentially can be explored for antiviral targets historically however drug discovery has focused mainly on viral targets because of their perceived specificity efforts to pursue host targets have been largely hampered by concern over potential ontarget toxicity the lack of predictive cell culture and animal models and the complexity of hostvirus interactions on the other hand there are distinct advantages of targeting the host such as creating a high barrier to resistance providing broad coverage of different genotypesserotypes and possibly even multiple viruses and expanding the list of potential targets when druggable viral targets are limited taking hepatitis c virus hcv as the example there are more than 20 inhibitors of the viral protease polymerase and ns5a protein currently in advanced clinical testing however resistance has become a main challenge with these directacting antivirals because hcv an rna virus is notoriously prone to mutation and a single mutation in the viral target may prevent the binding of an inhibitor and rendering it ineffective host cyclophilin inhibitors have shown promising effects both in vitro and in patients to prevent the emergence of resistance and to cure hcv infection either alone or in combination with other agents they are also capable of blocking the replication of a number of other viral pathogens while the road to developing hosttargeting antivirals has been less traveled and significant challenges remain delivering the most effective antiviral regimen which may comprise inhibitors of both host and viral targets should be well worth the effort,-0.093356193,-0.076670711,0.124515187,-0.126003597,0.123261604,0.069317054,-0.082114304,0.102317394,-0.030954937,-0.064806046,-0.044658745,0.060932374,0.010176913,-0.071625816,0.079294523,0.039670332,0.149100454,-0.072340784,0.187610761,-0.07528835,-0.032144773,-0.072526242,0.001416712,-0.069071031,0.064314877,0.012584002,0.012780755,0.03786387,-0.045068185,0.029192606,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

1896,in december 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the chinese province of hubei1 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition defined coronavirus disease covid192 the virus has now spread outside chinese borders with 82297 cases and 2804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of february3 after infection symptoms appear after an incubation time of 35 days with 80 of those infected developing a mild disease 15 a severe disease and 5 will require support in intensive care unit icu4 overall the estimated casefatality rate is comprised between 04 and 29 and the basic reproduction number is approximately 32845 sarscov2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist thus everybody can be potentially infected moreover no primary prophylaxis measures vaccination nor effective treatments are available if the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 spanish flu isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment ppe are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen which is presumed through respiratory droplets a 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases it is assumed that if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with covid19 he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed and the subject returned to the community domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support these rules are effective in controlling infections in the community but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection indeed the ongoing outbreak in northern italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and healthcare operators6 moreover the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of ppe used by the healthcare operators space dedicated and time employed in their management even more complex is the situation of patients in icu where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract therefore a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the healthcare system unfortunately the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding without an assessment of the infectivity kim et al7 assessed the viral load kinetics of sarscov2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in korea they employed realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrtpcr to detect sarscov2 and converted cycle threshold ct values of rrtpcr into rna copy number the detection limit of rrtpcr was 2690 copiesml overall viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection respectively7 of note both patients received treatment with lopinavirritonavir instead zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients8 they also employed rrtpcr and considered a ct of 40 as detection limit higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset overall only two patients prese ted positive samples and only in nasal swab 14 days after symptoms onset and with low viral load in conclusion a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients especially in icu is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission before their availability the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected,0.176086858,-0.036075734,-0.074144777,-0.110413826,0.050834189,-0.050460344,0.088640821,0.013691852,0.036034899,-0.039601326,-0.013865745,-0.020508235,0.09834714,-0.020716758,0.015767412,-0.037156638,0.022417342,0.04764541,0.024126947,-0.05861186,-0.022456137,0.061171195,-0.031309113,-0.094672419,0.05728455,-0.073092726,0.088404851,-0.025283477,0.038069706,-0.043287316,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
